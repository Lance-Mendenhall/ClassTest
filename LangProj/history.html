<title>History of PL/1</title>
<body style="font-size:1.5em">
<p class="a">PL/I was originally called NPL (New Programming Language.) The name was changed to PL/I (Programming Language 1) to avoid confusion with the National Physical Laboratory in England. (The compiler was developed in the UK.)

        PL/I was developed as an alternative to assembler( for low-level functions,) FORTRAN (for scientific applications,) and COBOL (for large-scale business applications.) PL/I incorporated the best features from several languages i.e., recursion from ALGOL 60 and formatted input/output from FORTRAN) in an effort to create a new, powerful, extremely versatile language. PL/I was the first large-scale attempt to design a language that could be used in a variety of application areas. All previous languages had focused on a particular area, such as science or business.</p>
